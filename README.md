Isso- fork – a commenting server similar to Disqus
============================================

Isso – *Ich schrei sonst* – is a lightweight commenting server written in
Python and JavaScript. It aims to be a drop-in replacement for
[Disqus](http://disqus.com).

This fork tries to keep ISSO upto date with some extra features.

You will have to build this project in your local environment to use this fork

If you are looking for a better supported and auto updatable commenting system, plese use the [original isso](https://github.com/posativ/isso) by [posativ](https://github.com/posativ/)

The usage is similar to the official documentation -> [posativ.org/isso](http://posativ.org/isso/).
